They can be used for a variety of tasks, including semantic search, anomaly detection, and classification. In the video on OpenAI Whisper, I mentioned how words whose vectors are numerically similar are also similar in semantic meaning. In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement semantic search using OpenAI embeddings. Understanding the Embeddings concept will be crucial to the next several videos in this series since we will use it to build several practical applications.\n","\n","To get started, we will need to install and import OpenAI and input an API Key. We learned how to do this in [Video 3 of this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYgjcZye1c).\n","\n","Video explaining this Notebook:\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzHhZh7F25I&t=954s"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8919,"status":"ok","timestamp":1678842482949,"user":{"displayName":"Alejo P","userId":"15450393507389467183"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"AUMmdUS_LPkI","outputId":"07431a3a-67ac-40be-9a89-c95a6d6efbc9","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m70.1/70.1 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.0/1.0 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m20.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m264.6/264.6 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m31.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m158.8/158.8 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m18.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m199.2/199.2 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m24.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m114.2/114.2 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m13.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h"]}],"source":["!pip install openai -q"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3459,"status":"ok","timestamp":1678842486400,"user":{"displayName":"Alejo P","userId":"15450393507389467183"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"bUPM0-8iLNK0","outputId":"24a03688-3f57-40de-da0a-aba993791670"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["··········\n"]}],"source":["import openai\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from getpass import getpass\n","\n","openai.api_key = getpass()"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"doKg5eSid9EK","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1678842506370,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":19979,"user":{"displayName":"Alejo P","userId":"15450393507389467183"}},"outputId":"10c7512a-3fa7-4591-c168-97dfefd610ab"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Microsoft Earnings Call Transcript\n","\n","Let's tie this back to finance.
